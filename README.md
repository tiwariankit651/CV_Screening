# CV_Screening

, in which we will build the “CV Screener” in JavaScript. CV screening is the most common type of assessment. CV screening is the process of shortlisting candidates from their CVs based on their education, skills. In this project, we will generate random data, and to get the images of random people, we will use random user API.
 Setting Up the Project:-
For this project, we will use the VS Code. Visual Studio Code is a free and powerful source-code editor that runs on the desktop. If you have not installed the Visual Studio Code yet, then click on the link below for installation guidance:



Create a new project folder in VS Code.
Inside that project folder, create two empty new files: index.html and index.js. 
The index.html file contains the HTML code. In this project, we are also using Bootstrap.
Bootstrap:-
Bootstrap is used for applying styling the user interface components. The easiest way to include Bootstrap is to add it from https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/getting-started/introduction/.
